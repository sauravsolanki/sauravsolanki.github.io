**5+ years of experience** building production ML systems at scale. Currently driving NLP and ML infrastructure at SumoLogic, previously built MLOps platforms and Edge AI solutions.

## About Me

**Senior Software Engineer I, Machine Learning** at **SumoLogic** — building intelligent query systems processing petabytes of log data. Previously delivered ML solutions at Sensehawk (Reliance Jio), DeepEdge.ai, and led research at IIT Delhi.

I specialize in:
- **Production ML Systems**: End-to-end pipelines from data to deployment
- **NLP & LLMs**: Intent detection, query understanding, fine-tuned transformers
- **MLOps & Infrastructure**: Automated training, versioning, serving at scale
- **Edge AI**: Model optimization for resource-constrained devices

## Career Highlights
